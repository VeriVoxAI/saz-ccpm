> **Think naturally. Ship professionally.** From "I want to build something" to deployed code in production.

SAZ-CCPM combines conversational AI intelligence with battle-tested project management workflows. Start with a vague idea, end with production code. No complex commands, no learning curve - just natural conversation that scales from prototype to enterprise.

## 🚀 Quick Start (< 2 minutes)

### 1. Install SAZ-CCPM

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /path/to/your/project

# Install (Unix/Linux/macOS)
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VeriVoxAI/saz-ccpm/main/install/ccpm.sh | bash

# Or Windows (PowerShell)
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VeriVoxAI/saz-ccpm/main/install/ccpm.bat | iex
```

### 2. Initialize and Start Building

```bash
# Initialize the system
/pm:init

# Set up your project context
/init                # Create CLAUDE.md
/context:create      # Analyze existing code

# Then just talk naturally!
"I want to build a SaaS dashboard"

# SAZ-CCPM detects project complexity and adapts workflow automatically
```

That's it! SAZ-CCPM will guide you through the rest.

## 🎯 How It Works

### Natural Language First
Just describe what you want to build. No commands necessary:

```
You: "I need a multi-tenant SaaS with Stripe payments"
SAZ: 💡 Let me explore some concepts for your SaaS platform...
     [Generates 3-5 detailed concepts with competitive analysis]
     [You choose one]
     [Automatically creates PRD and implementation plan]
     [Begins building with specialized agents]
```

### Intelligent Workflow Modes

SAZ-CCPM automatically detects your intent and switches modes:

| Mode | Triggers | What Happens |
|------|----------|--------------|
| 🚨 **Emergency** | "urgent", "critical", "down", "broken" | Quick context scan, then fixes immediately |
| 📚 **Educational** | "learn", "teach", "explain", "tutorial" | Step-by-step guidance with explanations |
| 💡 **Brainstorming** | "idea", "maybe", "explore", "not sure" | Generates concepts with feasibility analysis |
| 🏗️ **Build** | Clear requirements | Full production workflow |
| 🔄 **Improve** | "enhance", "optimize", "refactor" | Analyzes and upgrades existing code |
| 🔨 **Maintenance** | "bug", "fix", "issue" | Quick fixes without overhead |

### Adaptive Complexity Scaling

SAZ-CCPM automatically adjusts process overhead based on project size:

| Project Size | Detection | Workflow | GitHub | Example |
|--------------|-----------|----------|---------|---------|
| **Simple** | < 5 files, 1-2 days | `/pm:epic-oneshot` | Optional | "Fix typo" → Direct fix |
| **Medium** | 5-20 files, 1-2 weeks | Standard PRD flow | Recommended | "Add payment" → Full workflow |
| **Complex** | 20+ files, 2+ weeks | Enhanced + parallel | Required | "Rebuild system" → Worktrees |

The system scales process to match needs - no unnecessary ceremony for simple tasks.

## 💡 The Brainstorming-First Approach

### From Vague to Concrete
```
Vague Idea → Brainstorming → Multiple Concepts → Feasibility Analysis → 
Competitive Research → Starting Templates → Choose One → PRD → 
Implementation → Deployed Code
```

### What You Get from Brainstorming:
- **3-5 Concrete Concepts** with technical approaches
- **Competitive Analysis** of existing solutions
- **GitHub Templates** to accelerate development
- **Feasibility Scores** for each option
- **Clear Next Steps** to begin building

Example output:
```markdown
💡 CONCEPT 1: AI-Powered Analytics Dashboard
- Target: Small business owners
- Competitive Advantage: No-code AI insights
- Starting Template: github.com/vercel/analytics-starter
- Feasibility: 85% (2-3 weeks)
- Similar to: Mixpanel but simpler

💡 CONCEPT 2: Team Collaboration Hub
- Target: Remote development teams  
- Competitive Advantage: Built-in AI assistant
- Starting Template: github.com/supabase/team-hub
- Feasibility: 70% (3-4 weeks)
- Similar to: Slack + Jira integrated
```

## 🛠️ Core Capabilities

### Project Management Evolution

| Traditional Dev | Basic AI Coding | SAZ-CCPM |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Lost context between sessions | Some memory | **Persistent project state** |
| Serial task execution | Single thread | **10+ parallel agents** |
| Vibe coding from memory | Basic specs | **Brainstorm → Spec → Build** |
| Hidden progress | Chat logs | **GitHub audit trail** |
| Complex commands | Some automation | **90% natural language** |

### The Power of Parallel Execution

One "implement authentication" task becomes:
- **Agent 1**: Database schema and migrations
- **Agent 2**: API endpoints and middleware  
- **Agent 3**: Frontend components and forms
- **Agent 4**: Test suites and validation
- **Agent 5**: Documentation and examples

All running **simultaneously**. A 5-day task completes in 1 day.

### GitHub as the Backbone

Why GitHub Issues?
- **Team Visibility**: Everyone sees AI progress in real-time
- **Human-AI Handoffs**: Seamless collaboration between humans and agents
- **Existing Tools**: Works with your current GitHub workflow
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history from idea to deployment

## 📋 Essential Commands

While SAZ-CCPM works primarily through natural language, these commands give you precise control:

### Most Used (Daily)
```bash
/pm:init                 # First-time setup
/pm:status               # Project dashboard
/pm:next                 # What to work on next
/pm:standup              # Daily progress report
```

### Creating Features
```bash
# Natural language (recommended)
"I want to build [your idea]"

# Or explicit commands
/pm:prd-new feature      # Brainstorm and document
/pm:prd-parse feature    # Convert to technical plan
/pm:epic-oneshot feature # Create and sync everything
```

### During Development
```bash
/pm:issue-start 123      # Begin work on task
/pm:issue-sync 123       # Update GitHub
/pm:issue-close 123      # Mark complete
/pm:blocked              # Show blockers

## 🎮 Real-World Examples

### Starting from Scratch
```
You: "I want to build something with AI but not sure what"

SAZ: 💡 Let me explore AI application concepts for you...

Generates:
1. AI Writing Assistant - Like Grammarly but for technical docs
2. AI Code Reviewer - Automated PR analysis  
3. AI Data Pipeline - Smart ETL with anomaly detection

You: "I like the code reviewer idea but simpler"

SAZ: Refining the code reviewer concept for simplicity...
     [Updates concept with MVP approach]
     Ready to create the PRD and start building!
```

### Existing Project Enhancement
```
You: "My React app is slow, help me optimize it"

SAZ: 📂 Let me analyze your React application first...
     [Runs performance analysis]
     
     Found issues:
     - Large bundle size (2.4MB)
     - Unnecessary re-renders in Dashboard
     - Missing code splitting
     
     I'll create an optimization plan and fix these issues.
```

### Emergency Production Fix
```
You: "URGENT: Payment processing is down in production!"

SAZ: 🚨 Emergency mode - Quick context scan...
     [Detects Node.js project with Stripe integration]
     [Checks recent commits - sees config changes 2 hours ago]
     [Uses file-analyzer on payment configs and logs]
     [Context scan helps identify root cause 3x faster]
     
     Found issue: Stripe API key misconfigured in .env
     Implementing fix now...
```

**"Agent not available"**  
- Restart Claude Code: `Ctrl+C` twice, then `claude --resume`
- Check `.claude/agents/` for agent files

**"GitHub sync failed"**
- Verify `gh` CLI is authenticated: `gh auth status`
- Check repository permissions

**"Context overflow"**
- Use parallel agents to distribute work
- Run `/pm:clean` to archive completed tasks

**"Lost context after restart"**
- Run `/context:prime` to reload project understanding
- Then `/pm:status` to see current work
- Continue where you left off
